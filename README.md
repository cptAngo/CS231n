# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2019/) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2019).

Find [course notes](https://cs231n.github.io) and [assignments](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2019/syllabus.html) and be sure to check out the video lectures for Spring [2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)!

Assignments using Tensorflow are completed.

Assignment 3 will be added in the future.
